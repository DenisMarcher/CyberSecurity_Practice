This repository contains my practice projects in cybersecurity as part of my independent studies.  
Focus areas include: threat detection, network security, log analysis, automation, and hands-on pet exercises

## Technologies & Skills Demonstrated

### Programming 
- **Python** 
- **Bash / Shell** 

###  Network Analysis
- **Wireshark**
- **tcpdump**
- **scapy**
- **pyshark**

### MITM & Attack Simulation
- **Ettercap** 
  - Used to simulate ARP spoofing attacks in a controlled environment
  - Generated traffic to test my defensive scripts
  - Demonstrated how target redirection works
  - Allowed validating ARP-spoof detection and auto-protection Python scripts
