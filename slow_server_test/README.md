A small educational lab project that demonstrates how a slow or poorly
designed HTTP server can be overloaded with parallel requests.

Includes:
- a minimal vulnerable Python HTTP server (slow)
- a simple multithreaded HTTP load tester

All experiments were performed locally and for learning purposes only.
